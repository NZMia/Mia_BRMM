# Mia_BRMM
This web application is built for the BRMM Car Club to manage and display results for their monthly Motorkhana event. The application provides two distinct interfaces - one for public/driver access and another for club administrators. This README provides an overview of the project structure and key functionalities

### Assumptions and Design Decisions

---

#### Choice of Technology Stack  

- **Flask and Python**ï¼š
    - We have opted for Flask and Python as the primary development framework and programming language for this project. This decision is based on several factors, including their lightweight nature, ease of learning, and extensive community support. Flask provides us with flexibility, allowing us to focus on solving business problems without being constrained by overly complex framework structures.
- **Database Selection - MySQL**
    - We have decided to use MySQL as the database management system. This choice is influenced by its widespread use in the realm of relational databases, its outstanding stability, and robust scalability. The decision is further influenced by the structured nature of our data and our data management needs.
- **Frontend Selection - HTML with Bootstrap**
    - We have adopted HTML and Bootstrap as the frontend technology stack. Bootstrap's design philosophy and component library provide substantial convenience for user interface design and development. This choice enables us to focus more effectively on implementing business logic without expending excessive effort on interface construction.

#### Code Reusability
- **Component Reusability Strategy**
    - Certain components and functionalities in the project require reuse across different sections. To minimize code redundancy and enhance maintainability, we have opted to extract these components into independent modules. This strategy ensures cleaner and more reusable code.  

#### User Privacy
- **Role-Based Functionality Presentation**
    - In this project, user privacy and role-based distinctions are crucial for data security. For instance, specific functionalities, such as those intended for administrators (admin), require user login verification. While this design does not include actual login authentication, we have devised specific event triggers to simulate administrator privileges, ensuring data security.

#### Scalability
- **Addition and Maintenance of New Features**  
    - We have placed a strong emphasis on designing the project to facilitate the easy addition of new features, such as login and registration. This design decision allows us to extend functionality based on the diverse requirements of user roles and simplifies the addition and maintenance of new features. Such a design ensures long-term maintainability and flexibility for the project.

#### Error Handling:
- **Proper Error Messaging**
  - From a user experience perspective, we should not restrict user input. However, we can guide users by setting appropriate error messages, limiting their progress to the next step, and displaying error messages to them.

### Usage

---

To run the application:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up the MySQL database and update the database configuration in `connect.py`.
4. Run `python app.py` to start the Flask application.
